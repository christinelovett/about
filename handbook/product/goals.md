_Updated 2020-07-22_

## Longer term

### Increase user retention

- **Owner:** Product team (PMs + Design)
- **Timeline:** ~3-6 months
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Outcomes:**

  - Increase enterprise week 2 retention by x% through onboarding UX
  - Increase browser extension usage by x%
  - Increase Sourcegraph extension usage by x%
  - Increase WAUs (weekly active users) by x% though ______

## Medium term

### Validated and documented product/design/engineering process

- **Owner:** Product team (PMs + Design)
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Outcome:** Design is fully integrated into Sourcegraph (we operated for ~1 year without a designer on the team, and we are re-establishing how we do design at Sourcegraph). The collaboration process is docuemented and well understood (validated through real projects) by the entire team (product, design, engineering). New members to the team can quickly understand how we collaborate. Process exists to create clear lines of ownership and accountability, handoff moments, not to restrict or dictate how to work.

### Perform a UX audit and create a customer journey map of Sourcegraph

- **Owner:** Product team (PMs + Design)
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** Not started.
- **Outcome:** We understand the biggest pain points in the customer experience, backed by data. We have a clear understanding of inconsistencies and gaps across the product. This will enable us to prioritize improving existing against new functionality based on the impact it will have to the business.

### Increase customer funnel of feedback

- **Owner:** Product managers
- **Timeline:** FY20-Q3
- **Status:** Not started.
- **Outcome:** We are even more closely tapped into the customer experience, feedback, and voices. We are categorizing and surfacing insights weekly. We have increased the quality, frequency, and quantitiy of feedback from customers.

## Short term

### Design and component system for design/engineering collaboration

- **Owner:** Designers
- **Timeline:** ~1 month (Sept 2020)
- **Status:** In progress, currently contracting on UpWork to fill in gaps for core components of the design system for designers and developers.
- **Outcome:** Designers have a full system of components that they can use for design. It is clear when a new component is being created for both design and engineering.
